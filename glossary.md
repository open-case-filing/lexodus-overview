# Cloud-Native Platform Technical Glossary

## Introduction

This document provides definitions and explanations for technical terms used throughout the Cloud-Native Development Platform documentation. Terms are organized by category for easy reference.

## Infrastructure & Architecture

### Cloud-Native
A software development approach that leverages cloud computing to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Applications are typically built as microservices, packaged in containers, and orchestrated to optimize resource utilization.

### Kubernetes (K8s)
An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides features like service discovery, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities.

### Microservices
An architectural style where applications are structured as collections of loosely coupled services. Each service:
- Runs in its own process
- Communicates through well-defined APIs
- Can be deployed independently
- Is organized around business capabilities

### Service Mesh
A dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication in a microservices architecture. Istio, the service mesh used in this platform, handles:
- Load balancing
- Service discovery
- Circuit breaking
- Security policies
- Monitoring and tracing

### MinIO
An open-source object storage system compatible with Amazon S3 API. In this platform, it provides:
- Managed storage with configurable lifecycle policies
- Built-in encryption capabilities
- Scalable and reliable data storage solution

### Redpanda
A Kafka-compatible event streaming platform that enables:
- Event-driven architecture implementation
- Real-time data streaming
- Service decoupling through message queues
- Push notification capabilities
- Analytics data pipeline integration

## Security

### OAuth2
An industry-standard protocol for authorization that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts. The platform implements OAuth2 through Keycloak for:
- Secure authentication flows
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Token-based authorization

### Keycloak
An open-source Identity and Access Management solution that provides:
- User authentication
- Role-based access control
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Social login integration
- User federation

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between parties. In this platform, JWTs are:
- Propagated across services by OAuth_proxy
- Used for maintaining user context
- Verified at multiple security layers

### Zero-Knowledge Security
A security principle where service providers have no access to user data in unencrypted form. Implemented through:
- Regular key rotation (every 4 hours)
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure key management in Vault

### Vault
HashiCorp's secrets management tool that provides:
- Secure storage of secrets, certificates, and encryption keys
- Automated key rotation
- Access control and audit logging
- Integration with cloud providers' key management services

## Development Patterns

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
An architectural pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store. In this platform:
- Commands handle data modifications
- Queries handle data retrieval
- Separate models for reading and writing
- Enhanced performance through specialized optimization

### SQLX
A Rust SQL toolkit that provides:
- Compile-time checked SQL queries
- Automated schema migrations
- Type-safe database interactions
- Efficient connection pooling

### Circuit Breaker
A design pattern that prevents cascading failures in distributed systems by:
- Monitoring for failures
- Encapsulating logic for preventing system overload
- Providing fallback mechanisms
- Enabling graceful service degradation

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### CICD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
Automated pipeline for code integration and deployment that includes:
- Automated testing
- Security scanning
- Quality checks
- Deployment automation
- Rollback capabilities

## API Gateway
An entry point for client applications that provides:
- SSL/TLS termination
- Request routing
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- API versioning
- Request/response transformation
